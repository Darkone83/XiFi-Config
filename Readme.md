**A configuration tool for XiFi**

## What is XiFi Config?

XiFi Config is a utility app for the original Xbox that lets you configure and control your XiFi device easily from your console. The app features an intuitive menu interface and an on-screen keyboard for entering custom status messages.

## Main Menu Navigation

  Use the **D-Pad** to navigate the menu items (up, down, left, right).

  Press **A** to activate the highlighted menu item.

  Press **B** at any time to quit XiFi Config and return to your dashboard.
- **About Page:**  
  Highlight “About” and press **A** for credits and app information.

### Menu Item Notes

- Most menu items (except About) require a XiFi device to be detected before they can be used.  
  If XiFi is not detected, these options will be disabled.
